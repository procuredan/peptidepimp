  <p>Dual GIP/GLP-1 agonist for weight loss & metabolic health</p>

<main>

  <p>
    Tirzepatide is a dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist that has become well known for its strong effects 
    on weight loss and blood sugar control. It is considered one of the most powerful medical tools currently
    available for fat reduction and metabolic improvement.
  </p>

  <h2>Commonly Reported Benefits</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Substantial weight loss (often greater than GLP-1 alone)</li>
    <li>Strong appetite and craving reduction</li>
    <li>Improved blood sugar and insulin sensitivity</li>
    <li>Better portion control and satiety</li>
    <li>Support for long-term weight and metabolic management</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How Tirzepatide Works</h2>
  <p>
    Tirzepatide activates both GIP and GLP-1 receptors. This dual action appears to produce greater effects
    on appetite control, glucose handling, and body weight than GLP-1 agonists alone. It slows gastric 
    emptying, reduces hunger, and improves metabolic markers over time.
  </p>

  <h2>How It’s Typically Used</h2>
  <p>
    It is generally administered as a once-weekly subcutaneous injection following a step-up dosing schedule.
    Providers often start with a low dose to minimize nausea or GI side effects and gradually increase based
    on response and tolerability.
  </p>

  <h2>Safety Notes</h2>
  <p>
    Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea or constipation, and a feeling of fullness. Tirzepatide is
    not appropriate for everyone and should only be used under the guidance of a licensed medical professional
    who can review your full medical history.
