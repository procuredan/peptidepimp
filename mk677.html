  <p>
    MK-677, also known as Ibutamoren, is an oral growth hormone secretagogue. Instead of being a peptide
    injection, MK-677 is taken as a pill, making it extremely popular among beginners and fitness users.
    It is commonly discussed for improving sleep quality, enhancing recovery, stimulating appetite, and 
    increasing natural GH and IGF-1 levels.
  </p>

  <h2>Commonly Reported Benefits</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Deeper, more restorative sleep</li>
    <li>Increased appetite (helpful for bulking phases)</li>
    <li>Improved recovery and reduced soreness</li>
    <li>Potential increases in lean muscle gain</li>
    <li>Higher GH and IGF-1 levels compared to many peptides</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How MK-677 Works</h2>
  <p>
    MK-677 mimics ghrelin, a hunger hormone, and stimulates the brain to release more natural growth 
    hormone. Unlike peptides such as CJC-1295 or Ipamorelin, MK-677 works via the oral pathway and has 
    a very long half-life — often 24 hours or more.
  </p>

  <h2>How It’s Typically Used</h2>
  <p>
    Most users take MK-677 once daily, typically before bed or in the evening due to the effect on sleep
    and appetite. Because it can increase water retention early on, protocols often start low and increase
    slowly under medical supervision.
  </p>

  <h2>Safety Notes</h2>
  <p>
    Common side effects include increased appetite, vivid dreams, water retention, and insulin sensitivity
    changes with long-term use. It should only be used under the guidance of a qualified healthcare provider
    who understands your medical background.
