  <p>
    GHK-Cu is a naturally occurring copper peptide widely discussed in the fields of anti-aging, skincare,
    hair restoration, and wound repair. It plays a role in collagen production, tissue remodeling, and 
    reducing inflammation — making it one of the most popular cosmetic peptides.
  </p>

  <h2>Commonly Reported Benefits</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Improved skin elasticity and firmness</li>
    <li>Reduced fine lines and wrinkles</li>
    <li>Enhanced collagen and elastin production</li>
    <li>Assistance with wound healing and scar reduction</li>
    <li>Hair regrowth support and reduced shedding</li>
    <li>Anti-inflammatory properties</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How GHK-Cu Works</h2>
  <p>
    GHK-Cu binds copper ions, which are critical for cellular repair and tissue regeneration. It signals the
    body to remodel damaged tissue, increase collagen formation, and reduce oxidative stress. Users often
    apply it topically, though injectable forms exist in some clinical settings.
  </p>

  <h2>How It’s Typically Used</h2>
  <p>
    Most beginners use GHK-Cu as a topical serum or cream applied once or twice daily. Injectable or microneedling
    versions should only be used under professional supervision. Hair-growth blends commonly combine GHK-Cu with
    other supportive compounds.
  </p>

  <h2>Safety Notes</h2>
  <p>
    GHK-Cu is generally considered well tolerated. Some users may experience temporary redness or tingling with
    topical application. Always consult a qualified medical provider before using peptides or advanced skincare
    formulations.
