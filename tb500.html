<main>
  <p>
    TB-500 is a fragment of the naturally occurring protein Thymosin Beta-4. It is widely discussed in the
    peptide world for its potential to support tissue repair, reduce inflammation, and improve recovery.
  </p>

  <h2>Commonly Reported Uses</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Support for tendon, ligament, and muscle recovery</li>
    <li>May help improve mobility and reduce stiffness</li>
    <li>Often combined with BPC-157 for more complete healing support</li>
    <li>Discussed in the context of performance and injury prevention</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How It’s Typically Used</h2>
  <p>
    TB-500 is usually taken as a small subcutaneous injection, either systemically (such as in the abdomen)
    or near the area of concern. Exact dosing and timing varies by protocol and should be guided by a
    knowledgeable medical provider.
  </p>

  <h2>Safety Notes</h2>
  <p>
    TB-500 is still considered a research peptide. Most anecdotal reports suggest it is well tolerated, but
    long-term safety data is limited. Only use peptides under the supervision of a licensed healthcare
    professional who understands your health history.
